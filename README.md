# Vaterstetten in Zahlen

vaterstetten-in-zahlen.de is an open source project whose goal is to visualize (and gather, if needed) publically available data about the municipality of Vaterstetten.

## Development

### Initial setup

Install the newest version of R via the CRAN package, see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tags/r?type=tutorial&subtype=tutorial

Make sure the following packages are installed:

```sh
apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libgdal-dev libssl-dev libudunits2-dev libxml2-dev gfortran libkrb5-dev
```

Then, start an R session and install the needed R packages:

install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

### Start web server

```sh
Rscript server.R
```

### Tools

If you also want to be able to use the python tools, make sure to have Python 3.12 installed. Then, install pipenv and install the local dependencies:

```sh

pipenv install
```

To run the data poller:

```sh
pipenv run python tools/poll.py [OPTIONS | -h]
```
